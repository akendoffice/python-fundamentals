>>> #Queues
... 
>>> # It is possible for a list to operated as queue but its not efficient for this purpose.
>>> # While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from beginning of a list is slow because all elements have to be shifted by one
>>> 
>>> # to implement queue , use collections.deque
>>> from collections import deque
>>> queue = deque(["Arun","Kumar","Elen"])
>>> queue.append("Terry")
>>> queue.append("Perry")
>>> queue
deque(['Arun', 'Kumar', 'Elen', 'Terry', 'Perry'])
>>> queue.popleft()
'Arun'
>>> queue
deque(['Kumar', 'Elen', 'Terry', 'Perry'])
